My idea for the ad was more complex in post-production than some of my classmates. Iprepped for the photo shoot by coming in with a shot list and photo examples of lighting. Before the shoot, I had done a lot of planning and practice assembling the paintbrushes into letters. During the photoshoot, I had examples of the types of photos I wanted and a sketch of the final composition.I followed the photographer’s advice and adjusted my shot list during the photo shoot to keep the lighting consistent. I also used museum putty to help keep the paint brushes in place during shooting. I shot more photos than I used to create the ad, but it gave me a couple of options in post-production.","paragraphUid":"pvx9q"},{"paragraphTitle":"Role In Project:","paragraphText":"Art Director, Concepting, Research, Designer","paragraphUid":"oii74j"}],"subMedia":[{"mediaFilename":"Target_1.png","type":"Image","subMediaUid":"jxm5wq","mediaDescription":"Print ad for magazine spread"},{"mediaFilename":"Target_2.png","type":"Image","subMediaUid":"h7x86","mediaDescription":"Digital banner ad for website"}],"uid":"nizd","thumbnailImageFilename":"TargetTN_1.png"},{"mainImageFilename":"Ink and Drink.png","projectTitle":"Hamilton Wood Type & Printing","projectSubtitle":"Internship","imageName":"","projectParagraphs":[{"paragraphTitle":"Company:","paragraphText":"The Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum is in Two Rivers, WI.
