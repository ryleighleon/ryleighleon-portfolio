Hamilton has a gallery space in the museum and offers tours, workshops, and a store with prints and type to buy.

Role In Project: Researcher, Sketching, Concepting

The Process: During my internship, I led some projects and collaborated with other staff from the museum. For many of these projects, I did a lot of research and created documents for other team members to help communicate and organize my ideas."

Project Name: "Target Magazine Ad"

Type: "Image"
Description: "The Project:
Target is launching a new Mondo Llama product of paint and paintbrushes. They want a physical and a digital banner ad for the new product. A professional photographer will photograph the concept. You will direct them based on your sketches, mood board, and layout concepts to communicate your vision to the photographer.

Both ads need to include:
Target logo
Target Visual Identity
Headline and copy
Photography of product
Item name + price

Role in Project: Art Director, Concepting, Research, Designer

The Process:
I had about 15 minutes to shoot the photos I needed for my ad. My idea for the ad was more complex in post-production than some of my classmates. Iprepped for the photo shoot by coming in with a shot list and photo examples of lighting.
Before the shoot, I had done a lot of planning and practice assembling the paintbrushes into letters. During the photoshoot, I had examples of the types of photos I wanted and a sketch of the final composition.I followed the photographer’s advice and adjusted my shot list during the photo shoot to keep the lighting consistent. I also used museum putty to help keep the paint brushes in place during shooting.
I shot more photos than I used to create the ad, but it gave me a couple of options in post-production."
