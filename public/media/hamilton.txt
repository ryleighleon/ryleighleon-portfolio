Project Name: "Hamilton at the Farmers Market!"
Filename: "Hamilton at the Farmers Market.png"
Description: "At the beginning of my internship, Hamilton had a stand at the local farmers market. 
We brought pre-printed pages that said I love blank. Guests could fill in the blanks with their words, 
and we printed it in the blank area. Above, I printed a guest’s word on a tiny showcard press. 
I also cleaned and helped people set wood type."
